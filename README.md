# Algorithm Performance Benchmarking

## Overview  
This repository provides a collection of fundamental algorithms implemented to evaluate their efficiency and performance. Each algorithm is carefully tested and analyzed using `profiler.h` to capture essential performance metrics, including comparisons, assignments, and execution time where relevant.

## Highlights  
- Implementations of key sorting, selection, and graph algorithms.  
- Performance tracking using `profiler.h`.  
- Well-structured code with inline explanations of methodology and analysis.

## Performance Evaluation with `profiler.h`  
Each algorithm is assessed using `profiler.h` to measure:  
- **Comparisons:** Number of operations comparing elements to gauge efficiency.  
- **Assignments:** Number of data movements, reflecting memory overhead.  
- **Execution Time:** Benchmarked for selected algorithms to evaluate complexity.  

## How to Use  

### Clone Repository  
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/CalinaBorzan/Fundamental_Algorithms.git
```  

### Compilation & Execution  
1. Navigate to the specific algorithm’s directory.  
2. Compile the source code using a compatible compiler.  
3. Execute the program to observe performance metrics and output.  

Each implementation contains descriptive comments explaining the algorithm, its complexity, and profiling insights.
