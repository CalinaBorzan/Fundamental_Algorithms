# Fundamental_Algorithms
This repository features implementations of fundamental algorithms in data structures and graph theory, covering sorting, searching, traversal, and optimization techniques. Each algorithm is optimized and analyzed using profiler.h to measure performance metrics like comparisons, assignments, and, in some cases, execution time.
